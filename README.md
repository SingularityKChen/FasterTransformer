# Pytorch ViT int8 Data Dump

This repository provides a script to retrieve input and output data of functions such as softmax, gelu, and layernorm during the testing process of the ViT int8 based on PyTorch. The data is then saved into CSV files, allowing for further analysis of the computational characteristics of these functions during the execution of ViT int8.

## Model overview


More details of specific models are put in `xxx_guide.md` of [`docs/`](docs), where `xxx` means the model name. Some common questions and the respective answers are put in [`docs/QAList.md`](docs/QAList.md). Note that the model of Encoder and BERT are similar and we put the explanation into `bert_guide.md` together.
